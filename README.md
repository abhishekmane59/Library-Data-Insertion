# üìò Task 2 ‚Äì Data Insertion & Null Handling (SQL Developer Internship)

## üìå Overview
This project is a continuation of the Library Management System database built in Task 1. The objective is to populate the schema using various `DML` operations and to practice handling `NULL` values, `DEFAULT` constraints, and conditional updates/deletions.

---

## üßæ What‚Äôs Included

- Insertions into:
  - `Authors`
  - `Books` (including NULL AuthorID)
  - `Members` (with DEFAULT JoinDate)
  - `Loans` (including a loan with NULL ReturnDate)
- Use of:
  - `INSERT INTO`
  - `UPDATE`
  - `DELETE`
  - `NULL` and `DEFAULT`
- Conditional logic using `WHERE` clause
